The Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Varsity Math Team is one of the most successful math teams in the nation. VMT members participate in many different events throughout the year.

The majority of our events occur during the school day. We meet every Wednesday 8th period, plus certain days afterschool and/or during lunch. At meetings we give lectures, hold practices, and participate in regional and national math contests. We also travel to compete in many big-name math competitions. Any TJ student who enjoys math is welcome to join the team, regardless of skill level.

If you have any questions, complaints, or suggestions regarding the website, please contact the `officers <mailto:vmtofficers@gmail.com>`_.
