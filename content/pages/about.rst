About
##############

We are TJ Varsity Math Team, one of the largest clubs at TJ.  We meet every Wednesday A and B block, and have TJAIME/TJUSAMO lectures on Mondays after school from 4 to 6 PM.  Varsity Math Team prepares to compete at various math meets throughout the course of the year, such as `HMMT`_, `PUMaC`_, `ARML`_, and more.  We also have fun activities to spread our passion for mathematics.  All are welcome!
