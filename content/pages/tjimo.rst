TJIMO
##############

The TJIMO (Thomas Jefferson Intermediate Math Open) is a contest that VMT holds for middle schools in the Northern Virginia area. Schools that apply are accepted on a first-come first-served basis. Each school sends up to 7 students, but no two of them will be on the same team. We mix students up so that all teams are fairly even. The contest begins with an individual round, after which students will meet in teams of 6 to be coached by TJ students before the afternoon rounds. The afternoon rounds consist of a power round, where teams will tackle problems from a selected topic, a team round, where these teams of 6 will collaborate on a set of harder questions, a guts round, where the teams submit answers to sets of progressively more difficult questions, and an orienteering round, where students have to go around the school and answer math questions as they go along from room to room. The contest will conclude with an awards ceremony where winners are recognized - parents are invited.

The 28th annual TJIMO will occur on Saturday, March 4, 2017. Teachers may register their students `here <https://goo.gl/forms/OGZj76x8lz6zOU2V2>`_.
