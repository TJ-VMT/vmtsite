Hi everybody!

**This week**, we had the **ARML Power A block** and a **talk by Kevin Lin** B block.

**Next week**, we will **NOT** meet **Wednesday** since it's an anchor day. 

Next **Monday**, we will **NOT** have **TJAIME/TJUSAMO**, so please don't come to school.

**T-shirts** are now on sale. **Order a t-shirt** `here <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVHsvP5iF1PcgRpsn6yLmUXuqN5M5SVlnPfCxkA-I6fA-eiw/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=send_form>`_ **ASAP**.

Also, **sign up for academic boosters ASAP**.

As a reminder, please join our Facebook page (TJ Varsity Math Team).

Have a nice week!
